Simple tool to analyze numbers and show their properties.

There are no buttons, just begin typing a number in the top input field to start the magic.

Current version supports up to the number 39999 to avoid device lockups.

### Chrome extension (Experimental)

I've added a manifest and index file so the project can be used as a Chrome extension. Clone or unzip the project 
to a folder, go to extensions in Chrome, enable developer mode and click 'load unpacked'. Select the folder 
where you unpacked the project.
